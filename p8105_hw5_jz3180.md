## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Looking at the data:

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>

Try to iterate

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(path, read_csv)
    ) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  separate(
    path,
    into = c(NA, NA, "arm", "subj", NA)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    starts_with("week"),
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "values"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    week = as.numeric(sub("week_", "", week))
  )
```

``` r
experiment_df = path_df %>% filter(arm == "exp")
control_df = path_df %>% filter(arm == "con")

spaghetti = ggplot(control_df, aes(x = week, y = values, group = subj)) + geom_line() + geom_line(data = experiment_df, color = "red")
spaghetti + labs(y = "Observations", x = "Week", title = "Observations on each Subject Over Time")
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_jz3180_files/figure-gfm/import and spaghetti plot-1.png" width="90%" />

From the plot, the general trend of control arm subjects seem to have
stable observation values over time (period of weeks). On the other
hand, the experimental arm subjects generally seem to trend upwards in
throughout the course of the obervational time.

## Problem 3

``` r
ttest_sim = function(sample_size = 30, mu, sigma = 5)
{
  input_sim = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  ) %>%
    t.test() %>%
    broom::tidy()
}

first_sim = 
  rerun(5000, ttest_sim(mu = 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows()

data_sim = 
  tibble(
  mu = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    outputs = map(.x = mu, ~ rerun(5000, ttest_sim(mu = .x))),
    results = map(outputs, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-outputs) %>%
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(mu, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(
    rejected = case_when(
      p.value <= 0.05 ~ "yes",
      p.value > 0.05  ~ "no"
      ))
```

``` r
prop_reject = 
  data_sim %>% 
  group_by(mu, rejected) %>% filter(rejected == "yes") %>% 
  summarise(
    total = n()) %>% 
  mutate(
    proportion = total / 5000
  ) 
prop_reject %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = proportion)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(y = "Proportion of Rejected Null", x = "True Value of Mu", title = "Power of Test vs. True Value of Mu")
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_jz3180_files/figure-gfm/plot one-1.png" width="90%" />
Looking at this plot, as the true value of mu (effect size) increases,
the power of the test also increases in a shape similar to an increasing
log function. This increase levels off around 1, which is the highest
value that power can be.

``` r
avg_mu = 
  data_sim %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    avg = mean(estimate)
  ) 
avg_mu %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm) +
  labs(y = "Average Estimate of Mu", x = "True Value of Mu", title = "Average of Mu vs. True Value of Mu")
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_jz3180_files/figure-gfm/plot two-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
avg_mu_reject = 
  data_sim %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  filter(rejected == "yes") %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_mu_reject = mean(estimate)) 
avg_mu_reject %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg_mu_reject)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_jz3180_files/figure-gfm/plot three-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
  labs(y = "Average Estimate of Mu (Rejected)", x = "True Value of Mu", title = "Average of Mu for Rejected Nulls vs. True Value of Mu")
```

    ## $y
    ## [1] "Average Estimate of Mu (Rejected)"
    ## 
    ## $x
    ## [1] "True Value of Mu"
    ## 
    ## $title
    ## [1] "Average of Mu for Rejected Nulls vs. True Value of Mu"
    ## 
    ## attr(,"class")
    ## [1] "labels"

Looking at this plot, the sample average of mu across tests for which
the null is rejected is more approximately equal to the true value of mu
as the true value of mu (effect size) increases. This makes sense
because with lower power, the closer the average estimate of mu to the
null, the more likely it is to be accepted instead of rejected.
